Homework2: 
I search a key word 'dress' in www.amazon.com
It turns into this website https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2/138-1321468-5877954?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dress
and then I use [requests],[BeautifulSoup] to get the [item names] and the [prices] from the outcome page.
Finally I use [csv] to output them as a csv file.
